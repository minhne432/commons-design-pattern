Certainly! The Adapter Design Pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by converting the interface of a class into another interface the client expects.

### Scenario

Let's assume we have a system that processes payments. We want to integrate a new payment gateway, but its interface is different from the one our system expects.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### Step 1: Define the Target Interface

This is the interface our system expects.

```php
interface PaymentProcessorInterface {
    public function pay($amount);
}
```

#### Step 2: Implement the Adaptee

This is the new payment gateway with a different interface.

```php
class NewPaymentGateway {
    public function makePayment($amount) {
        echo "Payment of $amount processed using the new payment gateway.\n";
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Implement the Adapter

The adapter implements the `PaymentProcessorInterface` and translates the requests to the `NewPaymentGateway` interface.

```php
class PaymentGatewayAdapter implements PaymentProcessorInterface {
    private $newPaymentGateway;

    public function __construct(NewPaymentGateway $newPaymentGateway) {
        $this->newPaymentGateway = $newPaymentGateway;
    }

    public function pay($amount) {
        $this->newPaymentGateway->makePayment($amount);
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Use the Adapter in the Client Code

The client code uses the `PaymentProcessorInterface` and can work with the `NewPaymentGateway` through the adapter.

```php
// Client code
function processPayment(PaymentProcessorInterface $paymentProcessor, $amount) {
    $paymentProcessor->pay($amount);
}

// Using the adapter
$newPaymentGateway = new NewPaymentGateway();
$adapter = new PaymentGatewayAdapter($newPaymentGateway);

processPayment($adapter, 100);  // Output: Payment of 100 processed using the new payment gateway.
```

### Full Code Example

Here is the complete code for clarity:

```php
<?php

// Target interface
interface PaymentProcessorInterface {
    public function pay($amount);
}

// Adaptee
class NewPaymentGateway {
    public function makePayment($amount) {
        echo "Payment of $amount processed using the new payment gateway.\n";
    }
}

// Adapter
class PaymentGatewayAdapter implements PaymentProcessorInterface {
    private $newPaymentGateway;

    public function __construct(NewPaymentGateway $newPaymentGateway) {
        $this->newPaymentGateway = $newPaymentGateway;
    }

    public function pay($amount) {
        $this->newPaymentGateway->makePayment($amount);
    }
}

// Client code
function processPayment(PaymentProcessorInterface $paymentProcessor, $amount) {
    $paymentProcessor->pay($amount);
}

// Using the adapter
$newPaymentGateway = new NewPaymentGateway();
$adapter = new PaymentGatewayAdapter($newPaymentGateway);

processPayment($adapter, 100);  // Output: Payment of 100 processed using the new payment gateway.
?>
```

### Explanation

1. **Target Interface**: `PaymentProcessorInterface` is the interface our system expects.
2. **Adaptee**: `NewPaymentGateway` is the new payment gateway with a different interface.
3. **Adapter**: `PaymentGatewayAdapter` implements `PaymentProcessorInterface` and internally uses `NewPaymentGateway` to process the payment.
4. **Client Code**: The client code uses `PaymentProcessorInterface` to process payments. It can work with the new payment gateway through the adapter.

This way, the Adapter Design Pattern helps integrate the new payment gateway into the existing system without changing the existing codebase.
