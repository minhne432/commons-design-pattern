Certainly! The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that helps in constructing complex objects step by step. It's particularly useful when the object creation process involves many steps or configurations.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to implement the Builder Pattern in PHP:

### 1. Define the Product

The product is the complex object that will be built step by step.

```php
class Car {
    public $engine;
    public $seats;
    public $gps;

    public function showSpecifications() {
        echo "Engine: $this->engine\n";
        echo "Seats: $this->seats\n";
        echo "GPS: $this->gps\n";
    }
}
```

### 2. Create the Builder Interface

The builder interface defines all the possible configurations for the product.

```php
interface CarBuilder {
    public function setEngine($engine);
    public function setSeats($seats);
    public function setGPS($gps);
    public function getCar();
}
```

### 3. Implement Concrete Builders

Concrete builders implement the builder interface and provide specific implementations for each step of the construction process.

```php
class SportsCarBuilder implements CarBuilder {
    private $car;

    public function __construct() {
        $this->car = new Car();
    }

    public function setEngine($engine) {
        $this->car->engine = $engine;
    }

    public function setSeats($seats) {
        $this->car->seats = $seats;
    }

    public function setGPS($gps) {
        $this->car->gps = $gps;
    }

    public function getCar() {
        return $this->car;
    }
}

class FamilyCarBuilder implements CarBuilder {
    private $car;

    public function __construct() {
        $this->car = new Car();
    }

    public function setEngine($engine) {
        $this->car->engine = $engine;
    }

    public function setSeats($seats) {
        $this->car->seats = $seats;
    }

    public function setGPS($gps) {
        $this->car->gps = $gps;
    }

    public function getCar() {
        return $this->car;
    }
}
```

### 4. Create the Director

The director class defines the order in which to call the builder steps to construct the product.

```php
class CarDirector {
    private $builder;

    public function setBuilder(CarBuilder $builder) {
        $this->builder = $builder;
    }

    public function constructSportsCar() {
        $this->builder->setEngine("V8");
        $this->builder->setSeats(2);
        $this->builder->setGPS("High-end GPS");
    }

    public function constructFamilyCar() {
        $this->builder->setEngine("V6");
        $this->builder->setSeats(5);
        $this->builder->setGPS("Standard GPS");
    }
}
```

### 5. Putting It All Together

Now, let's use these classes to construct different types of cars.

```php
// Create the director
$director = new CarDirector();

// Create a sports car
$sportsCarBuilder = new SportsCarBuilder();
$director->setBuilder($sportsCarBuilder);
$director->constructSportsCar();
$sportsCar = $sportsCarBuilder->getCar();
$sportsCar->showSpecifications();

echo "\n";

// Create a family car
$familyCarBuilder = new FamilyCarBuilder();
$director->setBuilder($familyCarBuilder);
$director->constructFamilyCar();
$familyCar = $familyCarBuilder->getCar();
$familyCar->showSpecifications();
```

### Explanation

1. **Product (Car)**: The complex object that is being built.
2. **Builder Interface (CarBuilder)**: Defines the steps required to build the product.
3. **Concrete Builders (SportsCarBuilder, FamilyCarBuilder)**: Implement the builder interface and provide specific implementations for each step.
4. **Director (CarDirector)**: Constructs an object using the builder interface. It knows the sequence of steps to build the product.

This implementation allows for the construction of complex objects step by step, with the flexibility to vary the product's internal representation.
