The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying existing ones. This can be useful when the cost of creating a new object is expensive or when creating new instances from scratch is impractical.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Implementing the Prototype Pattern in PHP

#### Step 1: Define the Prototype Interface

The prototype interface will declare the `clone` method that all concrete prototypes must implement.

```php
interface Prototype {
    public function __clone();
}
```

#### Step 2: Create Concrete Prototypes

Concrete prototypes will implement the `Prototype` interface and the `__clone` method to allow for cloning.

```php
class Book implements Prototype {
    private $title;
    private $author;

    public function __construct($title, $author) {
        $this->title = $title;
        $this->author = $author;
    }

    public function setTitle($title) {
        $this->title = $title;
    }

    public function getTitle() {
        return $this->title;
    }

    public function setAuthor($author) {
        $this->author = $author;
    }

    public function getAuthor() {
        return $this->author;
    }

    public function __clone() {
        // Optionally, perform deep cloning if necessary
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Use the Prototype Pattern

Create instances of the concrete prototype and clone them.

```php
// Create an original book object
$originalBook = new Book("1984", "George Orwell");

// Clone the original book object
$clonedBook = clone $originalBook;

// Modify the cloned book object
$clonedBook->setTitle("Animal Farm");

// Display titles to show that cloning worked
echo "Original Book Title: " . $originalBook->getTitle() . "\n"; // Output: 1984
echo "Cloned Book Title: " . $clonedBook->getTitle() . "\n";     // Output: Animal Farm
```

### Full Code Example

Hereâ€™s the complete code for clarity:

```php
<?php

interface Prototype {
    public function __clone();
}

class Book implements Prototype {
    private $title;
    private $author;

    public function __construct($title, $author) {
        $this->title = $title;
        $this->author = $author;
    }

    public function setTitle($title) {
        $this->title = $title;
    }

    public function getTitle() {
        return $this->title;
    }

    public function setAuthor($author) {
        $this->author = $author;
    }

    public function getAuthor() {
        return $this->author;
    }

    public function __clone() {
        // Optionally, perform deep cloning if necessary
    }
}

// Create an original book object
$originalBook = new Book("1984", "George Orwell");

// Clone the original book object
$clonedBook = clone $originalBook;

// Modify the cloned book object
$clonedBook->setTitle("Animal Farm");

// Display titles to show that cloning worked
echo "Original Book Title: " . $originalBook->getTitle() . "\n"; // Output: 1984
echo "Cloned Book Title: " . $clonedBook->getTitle() . "\n";     // Output: Animal Farm

?>
```

### Explanation

1. **Prototype Interface**:

   - The `Prototype` interface declares the `__clone` method that all concrete prototypes must implement.

2. **Concrete Prototype (Book Class)**:

   - The `Book` class implements the `Prototype` interface and defines the `__clone` method. This class has properties `title` and `author` with corresponding getter and setter methods.
   - The `__clone` method allows creating a copy of an existing `Book` object.

3. **Cloning and Modifying**:
   - An original `Book` object is created.
   - The original object is cloned using the `clone` keyword.
   - The cloned object is modified, demonstrating that it is a separate instance from the original.

### Benefits of the Prototype Pattern

- **Performance**: Cloning an object can be faster than creating a new instance from scratch, especially if the object creation is complex.
- **Simplification**: Simplifies the process of creating objects with many configuration options.
- **Flexibility**: Allows for dynamic object creation and modification at runtime.

The Prototype Pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where object creation is costly or when you need to create many objects with the same initial state.
